      <h2>About the Coast to Coast Bioflight</h2>
      <p>
        The Coast to Coast Biofuel Airplane Project combined the excitement of
        aviation with the leading edge in renewable energy technology. Using
        aviation biofuel in a single engine Cessna equipped with an amazingly
        efficient SMA diesel engine, we achieved a 5,000 nautical mile flight
        from Rhode Island to California and back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to a sustainable energy future is twofold, increasing energy
        efficiency and using renewable energy. By increasing energy efficiency
        of our homes, appliances, vehicles, etc. we use less energy to get what
        we need done. By using renewable energy we are helping to ensure a
        sustainable future, a cleaner environment, and a better quality of life.
      </p>
      <p class="text-bold">
        This was the first transcontinental flight using aviation biofuel in a
        certified light aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aviation biofuel was made from renewable
        <span class="bold italic">Camelina</span> plant seed oil and blended
        50-50 with regular Jet A to meet ASTM D7566 standards. The biofuel was
        supplied by the Air Force in order to obtain additional aviation diesel
        engine test data. The aviation biofuel blend was run through over twenty
        lab tests to ensure it met or exceeded the required specifications and
        this aviation biofuel blend is a drop-in replacement for Jet A that can
        be used in jet engines, turboprop engines, and aviation diesel engines.
        With 50% of the fuel made from renewable
        <span class="bold italic">Camelina</span> plant seed oil the emissions
        are reduced, the carbon footprint is significantly lower, and there is
        no lead in the fuel. This makes it much better for the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        While some renewable energy technologies hold great promise but are not
        yet “ready for prime time”, diesel engines are a proven technology that
        have been in use for over 100 years. There is a reason the great 18
        wheeler “big rig” trucks travelling the world’s highways all use diesel
        engines. They are fuel efficient, powerful, and reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        With rising fuel costs and environmental concerns about the lead that is
        still used in aviation gasoline, diesel engines are a great solution for
        most general aviation airplanes. Along with the benefits of greater fuel
        efficiency, reliability, and lower emissions, aviation diesel engines
        can also use renewable aviation biofuels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SMA aviation diesel engine in the single engine, four passenger
        Cessna 182 we flew is 30-40% more fuel efficient than the avgas burning
        stock engine it replaced. This saves a lot of fuel, a lot of money, and
        is better for the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increasing energy efficiency and using renewable energy are the keys to
        a sustainable future. The Coast to Coast Biofuel Airplane Project
        clearly demonstrated this to promote renewable energy, aviation, and the
        excitement of real world science education.
